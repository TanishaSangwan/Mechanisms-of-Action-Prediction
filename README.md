# Mechanisms-of-Action-Prediction

We will log all of our research about the mechanisms of actions of various drugs and the different ways to predict it, though our focus will be more inclined towards building a machine learning model for the same. Initially, the repo might not be very structured but hopefully we will be able to improve it in the future.
